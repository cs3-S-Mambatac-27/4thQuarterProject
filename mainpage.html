    <p class="designingrobottext">The process of designing robots has a lot of process,
    they are a lot of processes on designing robots so the robot can function well.<br>
    Here are the Steps of Designing a robot:<br>
    1. Define the plan<br>
    2. Research and brainstorm<br>
    3. Select and plan<br>
    4. Build and program<br>
    5. Test and evaluate<br>
    6. Refine and communicate<br>
    Designing a robot is a challenging and rewarding process that requires creativity, technical skills, and a systematic approach.<br>
    So who are the ones designing the robots?<br>
    They are robotics engineers they are  responsible for creating robots 
    responsible for creating robots and automated systems that are able to perform tasks that humans are either unable or are dangerous.<br></p>
    <h1 class="h1text2">Programming Robots</h1>
    <div class="image-container2">

    </div>
    <p class="programmingrobottext">The Process of programming robots this process is very long.<br>
    This is Long because of the time to program the robot's artificial intellegence.<br>
    Many trial and errors will be spent in programming a robot.<br>
    Here are the Steps of Programming a robot:<br>
    1. Plan Your Robotâ€™s Purpose and Design<br>
    2. Choose Your Microcontroller<br>
    3. Gather Actuators, Sensors, and Batteries<br>
    4. Assemble and Connect the Parts to the Processor<br>
    5. Connect the Processor to Your Computer and Install the Necessary Software<br>
    6. Test Your Prototype<br>
    7. Mount All Parts of the Robot Together on the Chassis<br>
    8. Complete the Final Testing Phase<br>
    9. Finalize the Robot<br>
    10. Be Open to Further Changes<br>
    So now who are the ones programming the robots?<br>
    A robot programmer is responsible for designing and maintaining the control systems necessary to
    operate robotic applications in various industries. They work in close collaboration with engineers,    
    designers, andoperators to ensure the smooth functioning of robotic processes for optimal       
    performance and delivery.<br>
    </p>
    <h1 class="h1text3">What are the Various applications of Designing and Programming Robots?</h1>
    <p class="applicationstext">Robotics design and programming applications are found in a variety of industries, including space exploration, manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, 
        and agriculture. By automating procedures like welding, assembly, and material handling, industrial robots improve manufacturing 
        processes' output and quality. Autonomous mobile robots in logistics and warehousing enhance order fulfillment and inventory management processes. 
        Surgical robots are used in healthcare to perform precise operations, and assistive robots are used in rehabilitation and elder care. With its 
        automated planting, harvesting, and weeding capabilities, agribots transform farming and increase food yields while promoting sustainability. 
        While companion robots provide social and emotional support, service robots help humans in jobs like cleaning, security, and customer service. 
        Space robots make it possible for missions to acquire information and carry out experiments while exploring far-off planets, moons, and asteroids. 
        Students participate in practical STEM learning experiences through robotics education programs, which stimulate creativity.</p>
